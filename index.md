[Tentative course schedule](/lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/tentative-course-schedule.pdf)

 Date        | Lecture Notes              | Topics Covered
-------------|----------------------------|-------------
 2025-08-25  | [lecture-01](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-01.pdf)      | What is a linear system? And what does it mean to 'solve' a linear system?  
 2025-08-27  | [lecture-02](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-02.pdf)      | What do the solutions to a linear system look like?  
 2025-08-29  | [lecture-03](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-03.pdf)      | How can we solve a linear system without using subsitution?  
 2025-09-03  | [lecture-04](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-04.pdf)      | What is Gauss-Jordan elimination (AKA row reduction) and how can we use it to solve linear systems?  
 2025-09-05  | [lecture-05](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-05.pdf)      | What is a matrix, and what are the fundamental algebraic operations we can do with matrices?  
 2025-09-08  | [lecture-06](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-06.pdf)      | How do we encode a linear system using matrices? And once thus encoded, what can we say about the linear system just by looking at the matrix?  
 2025-09-10  | [lecture-07](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-07.pdf)      | What is a determinant, geometrically?  
 2025-09-12  | [lecture-08](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-08.pdf)      | What are the key properties of the matrix inverse?  
 2025-09-15  | [lecture-09](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-09.pdf)      | How do we understand (and compute) the determinant, algebraically?  
 2025-09-17  | [lecture-10](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-10.pdf)      | What are some useful connections between the geometric and algebraic interpretations of the determinant?  
 2025-09-19  | [lecture-11](lectures/lecture-notes-by-day/lecture-11.pdf)      | What are the essential properties of vectors?
